# Implementing an Information Retrieval Engine for IR Course 
in this project we are going to implement an information retrieval engine with these steps:
* tokenization with normalization
* creating inverted index and posting lists
* binary searching
* ranking search using tfidf weighting
### some ideas to increase speed:
* champion list
* clustering (K-Means)
### more options:
* using labeled datasets to predict label of new datasets and adding feature of classification searching
